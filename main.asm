# Main program that converts between 2 bases (milestone 3).
#
# TODO: implement the following.
#   1. Read the next source base and source number from in_bases and in_numbers respectively.
#   2. Print them.
#   3. Invoke ToBase10 to convert the source number to an intermediate base 10 number
#   4. Invoke FromBase10 to convert the intermediate base 10 number to the target base
#   5. Print the target number and target base.
#   6. Repeat until the source base is < 0.
